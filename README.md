# Accenture-Hackathon-2025

## Problem Statement
Enhancing Job Screening with AI and Data Intelligence 

### Challenge Overview: 
The recruitment process often involves manually reviewing numerous job descriptions (JDs) and CVs, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. The goal of this hackathon is to develop a multi-agentic AI system that can automatically read and summarize job descriptions (JDs), match candidate qualifications with the JD, shortlist candidates, and send interview requests based on the match 

### Current Process: 
• Job Description Summarizer: Reads and summarizes key elements from the JD, including required skills, experience, qualifications, and job responsibilities. 
• Recruiting agent: Extracts key data from CVs, such as education, work experience, skills, certifications, and other relevant information. Compares the extracted data from the CV to the summarized JD and calculates a match score based on the relevance of the candidate's qualifications, experience, and skills. 
• Shortlisting Candidates: Based on the match score, candidates who meet or exceed a defined threshold (e.g., 80% match) are shortlisted for interviews. 
• Interview Scheduler: Sends personalized interview requests to shortlisted candidates, including potential dates, times, and interview format written in email.
